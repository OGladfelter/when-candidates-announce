				<h1>7 Days After One Election, Another Begins</h1>
				<p>Launching a presidential campaign nearly two years before the election is rare, but not unprecedented</p>
				<p class="byline">By <a href="https://cultureplot.com/about/" target="_blank">Oliver Gladfelter</a> | November 15, 2022</p>

				<h3>Start Of 2008 - 2024 Presidential Campaigns, Relative To Midterms</h3>
				<div id="beeswarm"></div>
				<div id="tooltip" class="tooltip"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="scrollOnTop" id="step1">
				<p>One week has passed since voters went to the polls for the 2022 midterm election. Ballots are still being counted in nine House races. The Senate race in Alaska is continuing to a second round of ranked-choice voting, to be finalized in late November. The Senate race in Georgia advanced to a runoff election, to be held in early December.</p>
				<p>And yet, the next nationwide election has already begun: Donald Trump announced his candidacy in the 2024 presidential election tonight.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="scrollOnTop center" id="step2">
				<p>To be clear, seven days after a midterm election is unusually early to launch a presidential campaign. Since the 2008 presidential primaries, candidates have waited a <b>median of 164 days following midterms</b> to jump into a presidential race.</p>
				<p>However, Trump’s timing isn’t entirely unprecedented: the record for the earliest announcement belongs to John Delaney, who officially began his 2020 bid in July of 2017.</p>
				<!-- <p class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> I did not collect data on primaries before 2008 because collecting the data was a pain and it’s already 2am.</p> -->
			</div>
			<div class="scrollOnTop center" id="step3">
				<p>Andrew Yang’s 2020 and Mike Gravel’s 2008 campaigns also began before midterm elections, and Richard Ojeda’s 2020 campaign began just five days after the 2018 midterms.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="scrollOnTop" id="step4">
				<p>Notably, each of these former candidates known for early announcements are Democrats, giving Trump the title of the earliest announcing <em>Republican</em> since at least 2008.</p>
				<p>This fits a larger pattern: <mark>Democratic candidates</mark> for president announce a median of <b>123 days</b> after midterms, while <mark class="red-mark">Republicans</mark> wait <b>202 days</b>.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="scrollOnTop center">
				<p>Now that Trump has kicked off the 2024 primary, the big questions are: who's next and when will we know?</p>
				<p>And the answer is a resounding...</p>
			</div>
			<div class="scrollOnTop center emojiContainer">
				<p style="font-size:48px;">&#129335; &#10067;</p>
			</div>
			<div class="scrollOnTop" id="step5">
				<p>Predicting 2024 entries would most likely be in vain. Finding meaningful patterns in election data is rare, given small sample sizes and the fact that each cycle is so unique…besides the fact that every election somehow ends up being “the most important election in our lifetime.”</p>
				<p>Take the <mark class="green-mark">2008</mark> and <mark class="orange-mark">2012</mark> primaries as an example: in 2008, nearly the entire field declared within 170 days following the 2006 midterm election. Four years later, the <em>first</em> candidate waited 190 days.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="scrollOnTop center" id="step6">
				<p>One thing is clear: while Trump is unusually early in his announcement, he’s not exactly an outlier either. Don’t be surprised if more candidates announce in the coming months. But also don’t be surprised if no one else throws their hat in the ring for another six months. Honestly, it’s a crap shoot.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="scrollOnTop center conclusion">
				<p>Happy primary season everyone. May your Thanksgiving dinner policy debates be lively.</p>
